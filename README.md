# nodeApi-Posts
a small Node Api made with mongoDb to Get and Post posts to a database using validators.

After fork and clone  cd into root folder of project, type in npm i, create a mongoDB account, create a cluster and a collection.   Click connect to project.
copy and paste the key info into a new .env file made in your root directory of the project.  Save that key to a variable called MONGO_URI.

in your command line type in npm run dev.  and everything should be working fine.  Check connection is working using something like POSTMAN.  

thank you.
